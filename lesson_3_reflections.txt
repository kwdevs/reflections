When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Keeping all your work local only allows yourself access to the project.  By using a remote, you can access your project from anywhere and collaboration becomes effortless.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a clone of another developers repo on github.  A clone is a fork, but can also be a copy of a repo on a local machine or anywhere elese a copy can be stored.
    A branch is part of the commit history.  You would use a fork to clone a repo from one GitHub repo to your own.  You would use clone to save a copy of a repo on your local machine.  You would use a branch when developing a new feature or testing something that has no value being in production ready code.
